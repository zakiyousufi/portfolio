    recommendation: `
    Ahmad Zaki Yousufi is exactly the sort of software developer any company would love. We were working with the same startup Skill Development Camp, and all team was very grateful to have Zaki as one of our team members, He is very experienced and their skills in clean coding and explaining the concept of the codes are amazing. They have a great way of simplifying complex problems into bite-sized pieces, and as a junior developer, that was really valuable for me. The design and graphics he worked on are absolutely amazing. They're also just a fun person to chat with! If you need to get a job done simply and efficiently, Zaki's definitely the person for you.
